# Catamaran Backend API - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Successfully implemented a complete, production-ready backend API system for Catamaran - a privacy-focused family safety application for seniors. The system processes phone activity data while maintaining strict privacy standards and provides real-time alerts to family members.

1. Mobile app collects call/SMS metadata (no content)
2. Batches data and uploads via `/api/logs/calls` and `/api/logs/sms`
3. Server processes, encrypts, and stores data
4. Risk analysis runs automatically
5. Family alerts generated for suspicious activity

### Real-time Communication
1. WebSocket connection established with JWT authentication
2. Real-time status updates and family notifications
3. Heartbeat monitoring for connection health
